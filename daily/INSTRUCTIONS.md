## Daily Warmup

### Arrays
* Create an array of numbers, 1 through 10
* Write a function, called `forLoop` that takes an array as a parameter, runs the array through a `for(...)` loop and does a `console.log()` of each element.
* Write a function, called `whileLoop` that takes an array as a parameter, runs the array through a `while(...)` loop and does a `console.log()` of each element.
* Implement `.map()`, `.filter()`, `.reduce()` as regular JavaScript functions that take in an array as a parameter, but do the same things as the real functions.


### Objects
* Begin with the starter code in `starter.js`
* Using spread and destructuring assignment, create a new array called `newPeople`, which is a copy of the `people` array, with a person named `Odie` added to the beginning and one named `Garfield` added to the end.
* Using spread and destructuring assignment, create a new object called `newStuff`, which is a copy of the stuff object, with a new car added to the end of the `cars` array within it.
* Create a `state` object with keys of `people` and `stuff` that contain the `people` and `stuff` data.
* Do this using object destructuring assignment.
* Using spread and destructuring assignments, create a new object called `newState`, repeating the `newPeople` and `newStuff` steps above but directly within the `people` and `stuff` nodes of the `state` object (donâ€™t just spread in `newPeople` and `newStuff`).
* Prove that the original `people`, `stuff`, and `state` are unchanged.
